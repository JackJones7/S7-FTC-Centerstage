# Sensational Seven FTC 2023-2024 Centerstage codebase

Welcome to the S7 codebase for the latest season (in time of writing) of First Tech Challenge!
This is based on the RoadRunner Quickstart repo by ACME Robotics (Team #8367). We've been using RoadRunner since last season, and it's excellent for robot movement.
Feel free to use our code however you like, but don't forget to give credit.
